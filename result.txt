## 🧠 Key Findings

- **T cell exhaustion** occurs shortly after peak CAR-T expansion (~30 hrs).
- **BCMA+ tumor cells** are depleted early but escape may occur via antigen loss.
- Sensitivity analysis shows `k_exhaustion` is a key determinant of therapeutic failure.
- Suggests combinatorial use of **checkpoint inhibitors** or **cytokine support**.
